# Branch-Application
Branch application with html, css, and javascript
This project imports data from a javascript file to be rendered through the HTML web page. The data mimics a user filling in information about their home for an insurance quote. 
The document.getElementbyID was used in the js file and an import line with matching ids was used in the html. 
There are plenty of different ways to complete this project. 
Intersted in knowing how you would do it!
